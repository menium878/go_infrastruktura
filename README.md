Pomysł na projekty:
Sure, here are some ideas for embedded programming projects using Rust or C++:

Smart Home Automation System: Develop an embedded system that automates your home appliances such as lights, thermostat, and security system using Rust or C++. The system can be controlled via a mobile app or voice assistant.

Autonomous Drone: Build an autonomous drone that can fly on its own using Rust or C++. You can add features like obstacle detection, GPS navigation, and real-time video streaming.

Industrial Automation System: Create an embedded system for industrial automation using Rust or C++. The system can control machines, robots, and other equipment in a factory or manufacturing plant.

Smart Agriculture System: Develop an embedded system that monitors and controls the environmental conditions of a farm such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture using Rust or C++. The system can also automate the irrigation system and provide real-time data to the farmer.

Robotics: Build a robot using Rust or C++ that can navigate its environment, perform tasks, and interact with humans. You can add features like voice recognition, image processing, and machine learning.

IoT Security System: Develop an embedded system that monitors and secures your home or office using Rust or C++. The system can use sensors, cameras, and alarms to detect and prevent intrusions.

Wearable Technology: Create an embedded system that can be worn as a smartwatch or fitness tracker using Rust or C++. The system can track health metrics, monitor physical activity, and provide notifications.

Automotive: Develop an embedded system for a car using Rust or C++. The system can include features like advanced driver assistance, infotainment, and telematics.
